## Features
- Toggle desktop camera view
- Adjustable FOV 
- Adjustable Rotation Smoothing
- Adjustable Near clip plane 
- Camera offset to prevent head clipping

## Current Limitations / Known Issues 
- **In-Game Camera Conflict**: SmoothCam disables whenever the in-game photo camera is pulled up. Ideally, this should only happen when the in-game camera view is mirrored to desktop
- **Mirror Rendering**: Does not render mirrors correctly; they appear either black or empty, depending on their rendering type.
- **UI Visibility**: You cannot hide the UI separately from the in-game view.
- **Head Visibility**: The player's head is not hidden, which is what  the camera offset option adresses for now.
